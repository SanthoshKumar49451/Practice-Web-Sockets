WebSockets are a way for websites and servers to communicate in real-time. Unlike regular HTTP requests, which require a new connection for each request, WebSockets keep a constant, open connection between the client (like your browser) and the server.

Key Benefits:
Real-time updates – Great for chat apps, live notifications, gaming, etc.
Faster communication – No need to repeatedly ask the server for new data.
Bidirectional – Both client and server can send messages anytime.

How it Works:
The client requests to open a WebSocket connection.
If the server accepts, the connection stays open.
Both sides can now send and receive data instantly.
